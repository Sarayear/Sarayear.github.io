I have leaded by Dr. Joshua D. Patrick to examine a number of ways to model the spatio-temporal covariance structure of the irradiance data, explore simple models in which isotropy (independence of spatial direction) and separability (the time and space covariance structures can be expressed as a product) are assumed, research on more complicated models in which these assumptions are not made, use forecasting in time and spatial kriging as measures of how well the models perform. This research project won the First Prize of Research Exhibition held by UC Davis Statistic Department (The result published on Journal of the American Statistical Association by July/August. 2016)</p>
