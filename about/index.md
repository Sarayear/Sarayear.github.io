### My Education History

Hello, everyone! I am Shengjie Shi, a undergraduate student of statistics of UC Davis, also minoring Managerial Economics. I am also an international student who comes from China after I finished my high school education.

### My Data Science Skill

I have taken a bunch of courses about statistics theory and methods at UC Davis, such as regression,
mixed model, ANOVA, categorical data analysis, time series analysis,
statistical computing, machine learning and so on.  
For the program language and software, I am familiar with:

- R
- Python
- SAS
- MATLAB
- SQL
- Latex

Data scientist is my dream job because you can find a lot of interesting things
and help others through data and model.

### My Interests
Now, I am a data analyst at [Center for Educational Effectiveness](http://cee.ucdavis.edu/) of our school.
Our mission is to help the students get a better learning experience and maximize the
instructional effectiveness. My biggest interest is social science data analysis.
I am also interested in marketing and biostatistics.
In my free time, I love singing, Zumba and Guzheng, a traditional Chinese instrument.
Singing is a really good way to release myself.
