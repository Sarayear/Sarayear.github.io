### My Education History

<p>Hello, everyone! I am Shengjie Shi, a undergraduate student major with statistics in UC Davis, also minoring Managerial Economics. I am also an international student who comes from China after I finished my high school education.</p>

### My Data Science Skill

<p>I have taken a bunch of courses about statistics theory and methods at UC Davis, such as regression, mixed model, ANOVA, categorical data analysis, time series analysis, statistical computing, machine learning and so on. For the program language and software, I am familiar with:</p>

- R
- Python
- SAS
- MATLAB
- SQL
- Latex



### My Interests

<p>While working in the Department of Agriculture and Resource Economics at UC Davis, I have developed the skill and qualifications required filling this position. For example, I analyzed the data collected from the related filed of commercial research and helped to construct the SQL database for Professor Stephen Vosti. Also, I explored new method to manage and model the existed database by different software, finding new results by writing program code. I am able to PhD student who are not familiar with complicated program code of R.</p>

<p>As an enthusiastic data science professional, I wish I can keep working and learing new method to build up my own data science career path.</p>
